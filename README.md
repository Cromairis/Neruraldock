# Neuraldock - Proof of Prediction

This repository contains evidence that the concept of "Neuraldock" — a fictional brain-computer interface (BCI) described in my science fiction novel *Machina Ex Deus* — was created before Elon Musk's detailed announcements about Neuralink's advancements in June 2025. Neuraldock, featuring vision and hearing restoration (including congenital cases) via direct neural activation, was conceptualized and written between March and May 2025, predating Musk's public disclosures.

## Files
- **Chapter_1_El_Choque.docx**: The original Word document of Chapter 1 of *Machina Ex Deus*, where Neuraldock is first detailed. Metadata shows creation on March 14, 2025, and last modification on June 11, 2025.
- **Metadata_Screenshot.png**: A screenshot of the file properties, proving the document's creation and modification dates.

## Timeline
- **March 14, 2025**: Creation date of the document, marking the start of writing *Machina Ex Deus*.
- **May 2025**: Completion of the initial draft, including Neuraldock's capabilities (vision restoration with amplification, hearing restoration with translation, controlled by brainwaves).
- **June 11, 2025**: Last modification before Musk's announcements.
- **June 21-28, 2025**: Elon Musk announces Neuralink trials for vision ("Blindsight") and hearing restoration, even for congenital blindness/deafness, via direct neural activation (e.g., X posts and updates).

## Claim
The description of Neuraldock in this chapter anticipates Neuralink's advancements, which were publicly detailed after my writing period. This serves as a predictive element in my sci-fi narrative, aligning with a tradition of visionary works (e.g., William Gibson's *Neuromancer* predicting cyberspace).

## Purpose
This repository is a timestamped proof for:
- **Publishing**: To pitch *Machina Ex Deus* to agents/publishers as a prophetic sci-fi novel.
- **IP Protection**: To establish originality and priority over similar BCI concepts.
- **Promotion**: To generate buzz on social media (e.g., X, Reddit) and attract media attention.

## Next Steps
- The full novel is part of a planned trilogy, with this chapter as the opening. Stay tuned for updates!
